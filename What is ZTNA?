Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) is a security model that works on the principle of "never 
trust, always verify." Unlike old systems that automatically trusted users inside a network, ZTNA 
treats every access request as suspicious whether it comes from inside or outside the network. It 
constantly checks and rechecks the identity of every user and device, giving only the minimum 
access needed to do the job.
