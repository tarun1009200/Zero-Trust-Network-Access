# Zero-Trust-Network-Access
Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) follows the principle of “never trust, always verify.” It enforces identity-based policies, MFA, device compliance checks, and VLAN segmentation to reduce risks. With tools like Suricata and Intune, ZTNA secures cloud, remote work, and critical data while balancing productivity and resilience.
